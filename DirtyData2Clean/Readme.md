# Introduction

This folder contains examples of badly formatted data that I found interesting to clean using Excel and Power Query. I use R, Python, and Excel almost every day. I like to clean small data sets using Power Query because I can see the data in front of me. Anything large, I use R or Python.

# Background

## What makes a file interesting to clean?

Not all dirty data is interesting to clean. Some examples of not fun files to clean are:

* Files with lots of OCR errors<br>There is nothing worse than seemingly random errors.
* Files where the "dirtiness" has no structure that can be exploited during the cleaning process.<br>Finding the structure, often well hidden, is what makes a data set interesting.
* Files that never had any structure to start with.

So I file that is interesting to clean is one that has hidden structure that can be exploited by an elegant cleaning algorithm.

## Where do the files comes from?

Some from the web and some are from my personal work.

# Analysis

All the analysis in this folder is done in Power Query and Excel. Any Python cleaning is done in the PythonExercises folder.
